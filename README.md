# HTML Generator MiniProject

## Description
This mini-project requires me to design an application using JavaScript and NodeJs to create a basic portfolio HTML page.
This application will allow a user to create a simple HTML file from their input that creates a basic profile page for the user.
This profile page will include the user's name and location as well as links to the user's Github and Linkedin Profiles 

## Usage
To use this project, the user will need to navigate to my github page and clone the repostitory to their machine. 
The link to this repository is https://github.com/thomasjshea/HTML-Generator-MiniProject
Once cloned to the user's machine, the user will simply need to navigate to the location of the index.js file using the command line and input 'node index.js'
The user will then be given four prompts:
    - What is your name?
    - Where are you from?
    - What is your Github username?
    - Please input your Linkedin URL.
At this point a simple HTML profile page will be generated with the user's name and location with links to the user's github profile and Linkedin profile.
